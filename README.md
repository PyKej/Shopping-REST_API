# Shopping REST API

## Project Description
This project was inspired by an assignment from one of my courses at STU FEI University in the subject *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)*.  
I reworked the assignment into Python and added some extra logic to a few endpoints.

## Setup Instructions

### Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
````

### Start the Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Explanation of the command:

* `main` â†’ the filename (`main.py`)
* `app` â†’ the FastAPI instance (`app = FastAPI()`)
* `--reload` â†’ automatically restarts the server when you change the code
